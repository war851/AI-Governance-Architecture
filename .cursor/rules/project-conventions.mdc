# Project Conventions

## Agent Separation of Concerns

- Cursor owns: code standards, naming conventions, architecture patterns, file-scoped rules
- Claude Code owns: planning, execution, skills, agents, hooks, slash commands
- Shared layer owns: CLAUDE.md, plans, tasks, logs, docs/

## Code Quality Standards

- Explicit over implicit — never rely on side effects or implicit type coercion
- Every function has a single clear responsibility
- All error paths handled explicitly — no empty catch blocks
- No `any` types in TypeScript — use `unknown` + type guards
- No commented-out code — use version control history
- Comments only for non-obvious intent, trade-offs, or constraints

## Naming Conventions

- Files: `kebab-case.ts` for modules, `PascalCase.tsx` for components
- Variables/functions: `camelCase`
- Classes/types/interfaces: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Boolean variables: prefix with `is`, `has`, `should`, `can`

## File Organization

- Group by feature/domain, not by file type
- Co-locate tests with source files or in a parallel `__tests__/` directory
- Keep files under 300 lines — extract when exceeding this
- One export per file for main modules; utility files may have multiple exports

## Environment

- Windows 10, PowerShell shell
- Use forward slashes in config; PowerShell syntax in terminal commands
- All secrets via environment variables — never hardcoded
