description: Capture a lesson learned and update CLAUDE.md
---
Something was just corrected or a pattern was discovered. Encode this knowledge:

1. **Identify the lesson:** What went wrong, or what pattern was discovered?
2. **Categorise it:** Is this a coding standard, a gotcha, a workflow improvement, or an architecture decision?
3. **Write the rule:** Formulate a clear, actionable rule (not vague advice)
4. **Place it correctly:**
   - If it affects ALL files → add to `CLAUDE.md` under the relevant section
   - If it affects a specific file type → add to or create a `.claude/rules/` file with appropriate path scope
   - If it's personal/local → add to `CLAUDE.local.md`
5. **Confirm the update:** Show what was added and where

This is the Compounding Engineering loop — every correction makes the project smarter.
