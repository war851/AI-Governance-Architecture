description: Enter structured planning mode for a complex task
---
Before writing any code, create a structured plan:

1. **Understand the goal:** Restate what needs to be accomplished in your own words
2. **Identify constraints:** What are the boundaries? (existing patterns, performance, backwards compatibility)
3. **Map dependencies:** Which files, modules, or services are involved?
4. **Design phases:** Break the work into 3–7 numbered phases, each with:
   - Clear scope (what changes in this phase)
   - Completion criteria (how to verify this phase is done)
   - Estimated complexity (trivial / moderate / complex)
5. **Flag risks:** What could go wrong? What assumptions are we making?
6. **Present the plan:** Show the full plan and WAIT for approval before executing

Output the plan in a structured format. Do not begin implementation until the plan is explicitly approved.
